# Nova-express-ipsum

This dummy-text generator uses excerption from Nova Express, an experimental novel by William S. Burrough, written using  the 'fold-in' method, a version of the 'cut-up' method. The app generates output by cutting-up the selected text that is stored in two variables.

## Two output options:

### 1. selecting "words" radio button and specifying amount: 
Output is generated from a string variable by selecting random words and dividing them into sentences with a dash (instead of usual dot - same way as in the original novel) and capitalizing first letter of each sentence. Length of each sentence is also set randomly, but within a specified range.

### 2. selecting "paragraphs" radio button and specifying amount:
Output is generated using whole sentences from original text, stored in an array object. Array items are picked randomly, creating paragraphs, which are separated by a line break. Number of sentences in each paragraph is set randomly, but within a certain range.

**_From Cut-up technique wiki:_**
* _Cut-up is performed by taking a finished and fully linear text and cutting it in pieces with a few or single words on each piece. The resulting pieces are then rearranged into a new text, such as in poems by Tristan Tzara as described in his short text, TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM._
* _Fold-in is the technique of taking two sheets of linear text (with the same linespacing), folding each sheet in half vertically and combining with the other, then reading across the resulting page, such as in The Third Mind. It is Burroughs and Gysin's joint development._
